## üí° Pro Tips for Effective Prompting

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "I want a social media app," say "I want a Twitter-like app for photographers to share and sell their work"

2. **Include Constraints**: Mention what you DON'T want as much as what you DO want

3. **Provide Examples**: Reference similar applications or features you like

4. **Think About Scale**: Consider if this is a prototype, MVP, or production application

5. **Mention Your Experience**: Let the AI know your skill level with different technologies

6. **Include Business Context**: Explain why you're building this and what success looks like

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Copy this template** and fill it out with your project details
2. **Use the completed template** in your prompt to the AI assistant
3. **Reference the get-started guides** for implementation details
4. **Iterate and refine** your requirements as you learn more

Remember: The more specific and detailed you are in your prompt, the better the AI can help you build exactly what you need!

- **Add project-specific patterns** and conventions
- **Update examples** with your actual use cases
- **Extend rules** as your project evolves

### **4. Reference in AI Interactions**
```bash
# In Cursor chat
@cursor-rules
I want to add a new feature following our project patterns.

# In Claude
Please follow our project rules: [paste relevant rules]

# In Gemini
Use these coding standards: [paste standards]
```

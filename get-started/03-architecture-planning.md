# 03: Architecture & Planning

## Overview
This guide covers defining your system architecture, creating user stories, and planning your development approach.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Definition

### 3.1 Core Architecture Decisions

Document key decisions in `agentContext/architecture/ddmmyyyy_architecture.md`:

**Example Architecture Decision Record:**
```markdown

[Additional context, risks, or considerations]

## Related
- **Story:** [Story reference]
- **Epic:** [Epic reference]

```

## üö® Gateway Stories

### 3.6 Critical Validation Points

**Gateway Story Template:**
```markdown
# Story A-XX: [Concept Name] Validation ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

## Story Information
**Epic:** A - Project Foundation  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** üî¥ Not Started  
**Technical Implementation:** T-XXX  

## User Story
**As a** developer and stakeholder  
**I want** to validate that [concept] works in practice  
**So that** we can confidently continue building the full system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Specific validation criteria 1]
- [ ] [Specific validation criteria 2]
- [ ] [Specific validation criteria 3]
- [ ] [Performance criteria]
- [ ] [User experience criteria]

## Implementation Details
- **Scope:** [What to validate]
- **Focus:** [What aspects are critical]
- **Testing:** [How to test it]
- **Success Criteria:** [What constitutes success]

## Files to Create/Modify
- [Files needed for validation]

## Dependencies
- [What needs to be built first]

## Notes
- This is a **gateway story** - if this fails, we need to reconsider the approach
- Should be implemented before committing to the full system
- Focus on proving the concept, not building production features

## Success Metrics
- **Technical:** [What must work technically]
- **User Experience:** [What must feel right]
- **Quality:** [What quality level is acceptable]
- **Performance:** [What performance is required]

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** [What could completely fail]
- **Medium Risk:** [What could be problematic]
- **Low Risk:** [What's easily fixable]

## Go/No-Go Decision
This story serves as a **go/no-go decision point** for the entire project. If we cannot successfully:
1. [Critical requirement 1]
2. [Critical requirement 2]
3. [Critical requirement 3]

Then we should reconsider the project approach or pivot to a different solution.
```

### 3.7 Validation Framework

```

## üìã Planning Process

### 3.8 Story Mapping Session

1. **Identify User Types**
   - Who will use this system?
   - What are their primary goals?

2. **Define User Journeys**
   - What are the main workflows?
   - What are the critical paths?

3. **Prioritize Stories**
   - Must have (MVP)
   - Should have (important)
   - Could have (nice to have)
   - Won't have (future)

4. **Identify Dependencies**
   - What must be built first?
   - What can be built in parallel?

### 3.9 Ticket Breakdown

1. **Break Stories into Tickets**
   - Each story becomes 1-3 tickets
   - Tickets should be 1-3 days of work
   - Clear acceptance criteria

2. **Estimate Effort**
   - Use story points or days
   - Consider complexity and uncertainty
   - Add buffer for unknowns

3. **Set Dependencies**
   - Technical dependencies
   - Resource dependencies
   - Business dependencies

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Architecture decisions documented
- [ ] User stories created for all epics
- [ ] Project tickets defined
- [ ] Gateway stories identified
- [ ] Dependencies mapped
- [ ] Effort estimated
- [ ] Priorities set

## üöÄ Next Steps

After completing architecture and planning:

1. **[Environment & Configuration](04-environment-configuration.md)** - Set up your development environment
2. **[Backend Foundation](05-backend-foundation.md)** - Create your core service
3. **[Validation Framework](06-validation-framework.md)** - Prove your concept works

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Planning Issues

#### **Stories Too Large**
- Break down into smaller stories
- Focus on single user value
- Limit to 1-3 acceptance criteria

#### **Dependencies Unclear**
- Map technical dependencies
- Identify resource constraints
- Consider business requirements

#### **Priorities Unclear**
- Use MoSCoW method (Must, Should, Could, Won't)
- Get stakeholder input
- Consider business value

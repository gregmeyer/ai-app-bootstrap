# Bootstrap v0: Get Started Guide

## Overview

This guide provides a proven pattern for bootstrapping modern, maintainable applications with a focus on developer experience, clear architecture, and systematic progress tracking. Based on the successful setup of the Figma ↔ Mermaid Plugin project.

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. **Python-First Architecture**
- Backend services handle complex business logic
- Thin client/plugin shims focus on UI/UX
- Clear separation of concerns between layers

### 2. **Development Workflow Management**
- CLI-based development session tracking
- Ticket-based progress management
- Context preservation through markdown files

### 3. **Incremental Validation**
- Gateway stories for critical decisions
- Fail-fast approach for risky concepts
- Proof-of-concept before full development

## 📚 Quick Start

1. **[Project Setup](01-project-setup.md)** - Initialize your project structure
2. **[CLI Implementation](02-cli-implementation.md)** - Build your development workflow
3. **[Architecture & Planning](03-architecture-planning.md)** - Define your system design
4. **[Environment & Configuration](04-environment-configuration.md)** - Set up your development environment
5. **[Backend Foundation](05-backend-foundation.md)** - Create your core service
6. **[Validation Framework](06-validation-framework.md)** - Prove your concept works
7. **[Troubleshooting](07-troubleshooting.md)** - Solve common problems
8. **[Alternative Stacks](08-alternative-stacks.md)** - Use different technologies

## 🚀 Bootstrap Process Overview

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Day 1)
- Project initialization and directory structure
- Python environment setup
- Development CLI implementation
- Context management structure

### Phase 2: Architecture Definition (Day 1-2)
- Core architecture decisions
- User stories and tickets
- Gateway stories for validation

### Phase 3: Environment & Configuration (Day 2)
- Environment templates
- Setup scripts
- Git configuration

### Phase 4: Backend Foundation (Day 3-4)
- FastAPI application setup
- Project configuration
- Docker containerization

### Phase 5: Client/Plugin Foundation (Day 4-5)
- Basic client structure
- Integration testing

### Phase 6: Validation & Decision Point (Day 5)
- Gateway story execution
- Go/No-Go decision

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Daily Routine
```bash
# Start development session
python cli/cli.py start-session

# Pick a ticket to work on
python cli/cli.py pick-ticket T-001

# Update progress
python cli/cli.py update-context --type note --msg "Working on FastAPI setup"

# Complete the ticket
python cli/cli.py finish-ticket T-001 --summary "FastAPI app scaffolded successfully"

# Check status
python cli/cli.py status
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical Quality
- **Test Coverage:** 90%+ for new code
- **Performance:** API responses <500ms for 95% of requests
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime in production

### Development Experience
- **Onboarding:** New developers productive within 1 day
- **Context:** All decisions documented and searchable
- **Progress:** Clear visibility into project status

### User Experience
- **Functionality:** Core features work as expected
- **Performance:** Response times meet user expectations
- **Reliability:** System handles errors gracefully

## 🎉 Getting Started Checklist

- [ ] Project directory created
- [ ] Git repository initialized
- [ ] Directory structure created
- [ ] Python virtual environment set up
- [ ] Development CLI implemented
- [ ] Context management structure created
- [ ] Architecture decisions documented
- [ ] User stories defined
- [ ] Tickets created
- [ ] Gateway stories identified
- [ ] Environment template created
- [ ] Basic backend service running
- [ ] Core concept validated
- [ ] Go/No-Go decision made

## 🚀 Next Steps

After completing the bootstrap:

1. **Execute Gateway Stories** - Validate core concepts
2. **Build MVP** - Implement essential functionality
3. **User Testing** - Get real-world feedback
4. **Iterate & Scale** - Refine and expand

---

**Remember:** The goal is to validate your concept quickly and build a solid foundation for sustainable development. Don't skip the validation phase - it's your insurance against building something that doesn't work.

**Happy Bootstrapping! 🚀**
